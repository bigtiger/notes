h3. Notes

Hardest problem was finding a venue. Specifically being able to price them.

  - Bars - Ridiculous amounts expected of bar tab
  - Hotels - They make money on the food
  - Universities are big and bureaucratic entities (George Washington University)
    
    * Dragged their feet
    * Lost weeks of planning time
    * got jumped for an additional large fee at the end

Good resources for this topic:

* GoogleGroup for regional conferences
* Jeremy McAnally - Rubyist, RubyHoedown and more
* Joe O'Brien - EdgeCase
